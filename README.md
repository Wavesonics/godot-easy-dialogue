# Menu and dialog GUI for Godot

This project contains custom node types to easily implement a dialogue system with input and choices in Godot 3.2.

Features:

* Rich text support (formatting, colors, effects, etc.)
* Supports keyboard, mouse and multitouch screen
* Blocks the input while dilogue is open, making it "blocking"
* Arbitrary text breaks that can be associated with actions

__NOTE:__ currently only the text output is implemented

See the included demo for a complete usage example.
